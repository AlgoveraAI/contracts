# Quickstart: V3 Datatoken integration and support

### If a user is already minter() on the old V3 Datatoken, he can integrate it into the new V4 in 2 steps. 
### The main difference from v4 ERC20 is that minting has to be done from the NFT Contract and not from the ERC20 Contract.
#### The V3 datatoken is not compatible with Staking And Vesting Contracts and Fixed Price Exchange
